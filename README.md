# bg_remover_script_png_found_items

removes backgrounds of all PNG images in a given folder. 
Also converts jpg to png if there are any.

Requirements can be installed with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then just prepare a folder with images and run the script:
```
python bg_remover.py
```
at the gui window select the folder with images and wait for the script to finish.

You can find your images as png in the folder "pngd" and the images with their backgrounds removed in the folder "rembg".

Any issues or questions please let me know but please fix yourself if you can, because I cannot.
